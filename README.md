# 🧠 DEEPFAKE_DETECTION_MODEL

A full-fledged system for detecting deepfakes in images and videos using a custom-trained deep learning model powered by EfficientNetB0, wrapped in an interactive Streamlit interface.

## 📌 About

This project implements a deepfake detection pipeline from scratch. It includes:

- A training pipeline using EfficientNetB0 with fine-tuning.
- Real-time image and video classification using a Streamlit web app.
- Frame-by-frame video analysis for deepfake frame percentage.
- Robust handling of grayscale, RGB, and RGBA inputs.

The goal is to showcase applied machine learning, model deployment, and frontend integration for a practical AI application.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Training Phase**
   - EfficientNetB0 (imagenet weights) is used as a base model.
   - Custom dense layers are added for binary classification.
   - Trained on labeled real vs fake datasets.

2. **Streamlit App**
   - Users upload an image or video.
   - For images: Model instantly classifies as **Fake** or **Real**.
   - For videos: Each frame is predicted, and a percentage of fake frames is shown.
